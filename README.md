# EnergyEfficiency

This is a data science project I completed for my MIST 5620 class. The dataset we worked with was regarding the energy efficiency (heating load and cooling load) of different buildings.

In the R file, we created multiple linear models and a neural network as well.

We divided our data into two segments: training and testing. Below is a comparison of the linear model and neural network predictions on test data, after we trained both models on the training data.

As you can see the neural network was very effective at predicting the heating load of a building based on the predictor variables we supplied.

Last, here is a graphical representation of the neural network.
